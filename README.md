# LinkedinEmails
![LinkedinEmails](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26238419/231917888-746674c1-f93e-4610-a1b5-6aec8a297ccf.png)
Searches for employees of a company on linkedin using [PuppeteerSharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) and outputs a list composed of full names and possible emails.<br />

It's now also possible to validate the emails for each employee using SMTP, note that this is not always 100% reliable.<br />

This application might stop working on the future due to changes in Linkedin, I will try to keep it up to date.<br />


## Building and Running

It's possible to create builds for Windows, Linux and macOS since the project is done in .NET Core 6.

### Step 1: Download and Install .NET Core 6.0 SDK

Download and install the .NET Core 6.0 SDK from the official website:
[.NET Core 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Restore Dependencies
```bash

```

Make sure to pass the arguments needed.

### Step 5: Publish the Project (Optional)
